# Backend FastAPI and Frontend with JINJA2

GitHub - Public Repository


FastAPI, as the name suggests, is an ASGI python-based framework that is much faster than Django and Flask. It comes with Pydantic and Starlette and is proving to be the best py-candidate.

Documentation

The first thing I notice from FastAPI is the documentation. FastAPI has very extensive documentation and rich examples, which makes things easier. If you need to look for something about FastAPI, you usually don’t need to look anywhere else.
In addition, FastAPI will automatically generate interactive API documentation from the program we are running. So that we don’t need to write the API documentation that we created ourselves. As we all know, writing API documentation is annoying, not only because there is a lot of detail to go into, but also nothing more frustrating when the end-users are implementing but not match up the documentation. So that with the automatic generation of API documentation it will be very helpful
